# Phase 4: Configuration Sorting

## Overview

Phase 4 implements configuration file sorting while maintaining structure and comments. This phase builds upon the file detection system from Phase 3 to provide intelligent sorting of configuration files for improved readability and maintainability.

## Core Requirements

### Sorting Framework

1. Command Structure

   ```python
   @cli.command()
   @click.option("--verbose", is_flag=True, help="Show detailed output")
   @click.option("--dry-run", is_flag=True, help="Show what would be done without making changes")
   @click.option("--backup", is_flag=True, help="Create backup before sorting")
   @click.option("--verify", is_flag=True, help="Verify file structure after sort")
   @click.argument("files", nargs=-1, required=True, type=click.Path(exists=True))
   def sort(verbose: bool, dry_run: bool, backup: bool, verify: bool, files: tuple[str, ...]) -> None:
       """Sort configuration files maintaining structure and comments.
       
       The sort command organizes stanzas and settings within Splunk configuration files
       while preserving comments and structure.
       """
       # Implementation details here
   ```

2. Sort Functionality
   - Sort stanzas according to Splunk's logical priority order:
     - Primary Order (Highest to Lowest Priority):
       - Global settings (no stanza header)
       - Default stanza: Exact match "[default]"
       - Global wildcard stanzas: Match pattern "[*::attribute]"
       - Specific type stanzas: All "[type::*]" and "[type::attribute]" patterns
     - Secondary Order (within specific type groups):
       - Wildcard attribute "[type::*]"
       - Wildcard-prefixed attribute "[type::*-attribute]"
       - Specific attribute "[type::attribute]"
   - Sort settings alphabetically within each stanza
   - Maintain all comments and their associations with stanzas/settings
   - Support options for customizing sort behavior
   - Handle multiple files in a single command

3. Preservation Requirements
   - Maintain all comments with specific association rules:
     - Comments directly above stanza: Associated with that stanza
     - Comments after stanza header: Prompt for association
     - Comments directly above key=value: Associated with that pair
     - Inline value comments: Move with the value
     - Comments followed by blank line and another stanza: Associated with previous stanza block
   - Preserve blank lines between stanzas for readability
   - Keep comment-to-setting associations intact
   - Retain the original file encoding and line endings

4. Safety Features
   - Include a dry-run mode to preview changes without modifying files
   - Offer backup option to create copies before sorting
   - Verification option to validate file structure after sorting
   - Handle errors gracefully with informative messages

### Technical Specifications

1. Parser Enhancements
   - Extend the configuration parser from Phase 3 to track comments and their relationships to settings/stanzas
   - Create data structures that preserve the comment associations during sorting
   - Implement stanza type detection for proper classification and sorting

2. Sorting Algorithms
   - Implement priority-based sorting for stanzas according to Splunk's logical order
   - Implement alpha-sorting for settings within stanzas
   - Support custom sort orders for special stanzas (e.g., [default] always first)
   - Allow for special handling of certain configuration files based on type

3. Output Generation
   - Create a mechanism to rewrite files while maintaining formatting
   - Support different line endings (CRLF/LF) based on the original file
   - Ensure proper handling of encoding during read/write operations

4. Validation
   - Verify structural integrity after sorting
   - Compare key counts before and after to ensure no data loss
   - Check for parser errors after regenerating files

5. Processing Scope
   - Support both single file and full TA sorting
   - Apply to configuration and metadata files only
   - Maintain consistent sorting across all TAs
   - Support integration with merge operations

## Implementation Guidelines

### File Structure

1. Core Files
   - `src/bydefault/commands/sort.py`: Main sort command implementation
   - `src/bydefault/models/sort_models.py`: Data models for sorting operations
   - `src/bydefault/models/stanza.py`: Stanza classification and ordering models
   - `src/bydefault/utils/sort_utils.py`: Utility functions for sorting
   - `src/bydefault/utils/parser.py`: Enhanced parser for comment-preserving parsing
   - `src/bydefault/utils/writer.py`: File writer that maintains structure
   - `tests/commands/test_sort.py`: Tests for the sort command
   - `tests/utils/test_sort_utils.py`: Tests for sorting utilities

2. Key Classes and Functions
   - `sort()`: Main command function in commands/sort.py
   - `ConfigSorter`: Main class handling the sorting process (in utils/sort_utils.py)
   - `CommentAwareParser`: Parser that preserves comment relationships (in utils/parser.py)
   - `SortedConfigWriter`: Writer that outputs sorted config while preserving structure (in utils/writer.py)
   - `StanzaType`: Enum defining stanza classification types (in models/stanza.py)
   - `SortResult`: Data class for sorting results (in models/sort_models.py)

### Testing Strategy

1. Test Categories
   - Unit tests for individual sorter components
   - Integration tests for the complete sort process
   - Property-based tests to verify sort invariants (e.g., key count preservation)
   - Edge case tests for unusual file formats

2. Test Fixtures
   - Sample configurations with varied complexity
   - Files with different comment styles and placements
   - Configurations with special format requirements
   - Files with different encodings and line endings
   - Examples of all stanza types and ordering scenarios

3. Validation Tests
   - Verify stanza order matches expected order after sorting
   - Confirm all comments are preserved in appropriate locations
   - Check that blank line structure is maintained
   - Ensure file validation succeeds after sorting
   - Test correct handling of comments with ambiguous associations

## Command Usage Examples

1. Basic Sorting

   ```bash
   bydefault sort inputs.conf
   ```

2. Sorting with Backup

   ```bash
   bydefault sort --backup props.conf transforms.conf
   ```

3. Dry Run Mode

   ```bash
   bydefault sort --dry-run --verbose app.conf
   ```

4. Sort with Verification

   ```bash
   bydefault sort --verify props.conf
   ```

5. Batch Sorting

   ```bash
   bydefault sort *.conf
   ```
