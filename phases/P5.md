# Phase 5: Configuration Merging

## Overview

Phase 5 implements configuration merging between local and default directories. This phase builds upon the sorting functionality from Phase 4 and integrates with the scan command from Phase 3 to provide a comprehensive solution for managing Splunk TA configurations.

## Core Requirements

### Merging Framework

1. Command Structure

   ```python
   @cli.command()
   @click.option("--verbose", is_flag=True, help="Show detailed output")
   @click.option("--dry-run", is_flag=True, help="Show what would be done without making changes")
   @click.option("--no-backup", is_flag=True, help="Skip creating backup (backup is created by default)")
   @click.option("--mode", type=click.Choice(['merge', 'replace']), 
                 default='merge', help="How to handle local changes (default: merge)")
   @click.argument("ta_path", type=click.Path(exists=True))
   def merge(verbose: bool, dry_run: bool, no_backup: bool, mode: str, ta_path: str) -> None:
       """Merge local configurations into default directory.
       
       The merge command combines changes from local directory into the default directory.
       By default, it merges changes while preserving default values not in local.
       Use --mode=replace to completely replace default stanzas with local ones.
       
       A backup is automatically created unless --no-backup is specified.
       """
       # Implementation details here
   ```

2. Merge Functionality
   - Process all configuration files in local directory
   - Handle stanza-level merging based on mode:
     - merge: Combine local and default, preferring local values
     - replace: Complete replacement of default stanzas with local ones
   - Setting-level behavior:
     - merge mode:
       - Use local values for any settings in local
       - Preserve default settings not present in local
     - replace mode:
       - Only keep settings present in local
       - Remove all other settings from default
   - Support options for customizing merge behavior
   - Integrate with sort command for final organization

3. Preservation Requirements
   - Maintain all comments with specific association rules:
     - merge mode: 
       - Keep default comments for preserved settings
       - Use local comments for local settings
     - replace mode:
       - Use only comments from local
       - Remove comments for removed settings
   - Preserve blank lines between stanzas for readability
   - Keep comment-to-setting associations intact
   - Retain the original file encoding and line endings

4. Safety Features
   - Backup enabled by default, with option to disable
   - Include a dry-run mode to preview changes
   - Handle errors gracefully with informative messages
   - Validate files before and after merging

### Technical Specifications

1. Merger Implementation
   - Extend the configuration parser to support merging
   - Create data structures for tracking merged content
   - Implement mode-specific merge logic
   - Support comment preservation during merging

2. Mode-Specific Behavior
   - merge mode (default):
     - Preserves structure of default file
     - Updates values from local
     - Keeps default settings not in local
   - replace mode:
     - Takes structure from local file
     - Removes settings not in local
     - Complete stanza replacement

   Example Mode Behavior:

   ```ini
   # default/props.conf (original)
   [apache_access]
   SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
   TRUNCATE = 10000
   TIME_PREFIX = \[
   TRANSFORMS-example = old_transform

   # local/props.conf (changes)
   [apache_access]
   SHOULD_LINEMERGE = true
   TRUNCATE = 8000
   MAX_TIMESTAMP_LOOKAHEAD = 40

   # Result with --mode=merge (default)
   [apache_access]
   SHOULD_LINEMERGE = true   # Took local value
   TRUNCATE = 8000          # Took local value
   TIME_PREFIX = \[         # Kept from default (not in local)
   TRANSFORMS-example = old_transform  # Kept from default (not in local)
   MAX_TIMESTAMP_LOOKAHEAD = 40  # Added from local

   # Result with --mode=replace
   [apache_access]
   SHOULD_LINEMERGE = true   # Only kept what's in local
   TRUNCATE = 8000          # Only kept what's in local
   MAX_TIMESTAMP_LOOKAHEAD = 40  # Only kept what's in local
   ```

   In both modes:
   - New stanzas from local are always added
   - Stanzas only in default are always preserved
   - File-level comments are preserved

3. Output Generation
   - Create a mechanism to write merged files
   - Support different line endings (CRLF/LF)
   - Ensure proper handling of encoding
   - Integrate with sort command for final organization

4. Validation
   - Verify structural integrity after merging
   - Compare key counts before and after
   - Check for parser errors after regenerating
   - Validate merged files match expected format

5. Processing Scope
   - Support both single file and full TA merging
   - Apply to configuration and metadata files
   - Handle directory structure differences
   - Support selective merging of specific files

## Implementation Guidelines

## Command Usage Examples

1. Basic Merging (creates backup by default)

   ```bash
   bydefault merge path/to/ta
   ```

2. Replace Mode (creates backup by default)

   ```bash
   bydefault merge --mode=replace path/to/ta
   ```

3. Dry Run Mode

   ```bash
   bydefault merge --dry-run --verbose path/to/ta
   ```

4. Merge Without Backup

   ```bash
   bydefault merge --no-backup path/to/ta
   ```

5. Replace Without Backup

   ```bash
   bydefault merge --mode=replace --no-backup path/to/ta
   ```
