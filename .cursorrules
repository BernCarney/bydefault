        "    - Single Responsibility: Each class/module should have only one reason to change",
        "    - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification",
        "    - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types",
        "    - Interface Segregation: Many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface",
        "    - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions",
        "  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate duplication through abstraction",
        "  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Favor simplicity over complexity",
        "  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Only implement what is currently needed",
        "Prioritize maintainability and clarity over clever or complex solutions",
        "Phase-based development requirements:",
        "  - Each phase builds upon prior phases without modifying existing functionality",
        "  - Only modify previous phase code when absolutely necessary",
        "  - Document thoroughly any changes to previous phase implementations",
        "Command design principles:",
        "  - Commands should be additive and integrative with existing functionality",
        "  - New commands must not break existing command behavior",
        "  - All commands should follow consistent patterns for options and output",
        "  - Design commands to be composable where appropriate"
